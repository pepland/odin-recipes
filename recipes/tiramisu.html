    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is the ultimate Italian dessert, a true masterpiece! It's incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious, using just four main ingredients: mascarpone cheese, eggs, ladyfingers, and coffee.</p>
    <p>This no-bake dessert is always a hit and has many different versions. The one I'm sharing here is a classic tiramisu, based on the traditional Italian recipe. That means you won't find ANY cream, vanilla, salt, chocolate, or other ingredients that don't belong in the traditional version!</p>
    <p>After assembling the tiramisu, it's a good practice to let it set in the refrigerator for at least three hours before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together and the dessert to firm up.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g   ladyfingers - (Savoiardi), about 30 cookies</li>
        <li>500 g   mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>4       medium eggs</li>
        <li>100 g   granulated sugar</li>
        <li>300 ml  coffee - espresso</li>
        <li>2       tablespoons of Marsala Wine</li>
        <li>        unsweetened cocoa powder - for decoration</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the coffee. Then add 2 tablespoons of Marsala wine. Set aside and let cool.</li>
        <li>Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the yolks and whip the egg whites until stiff. Once ready, set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spoon to make it softer. When the yolks are ready add the mascarpone cheese.</li>
        <li>Whip the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites. Mix with a wooden spoon, from bottom up. Mix slowly until smooth and creamy</li>
        <li>Dip the ladyfingers quickly (1 or 2 seconds) into the coffee. Then arrange the ladyfingers in the casserole of your liking.</li>
        <li>Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole. Then spread the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers</li>
        <li>Add another layer of ladyfingers and then top with more mascarpone cream. If you are making the last layer, spread the mascarpone cream generously.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with cocoa powder. Allow to rest 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Even better if you prepare the tiramisu the day before, letting it rest overnight.</li>
    </ol>
