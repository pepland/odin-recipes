    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic second course of popular cuisine, rich and tasty and perfect for Sunday lunch with the family.</p>
    <p>The best way to enjoy this second course is to accompany it with some nice slices of homemade bread, maybe toasted, for a mouth-watering “scarpetta”. If we want, however, we can also combine it with a side dish of vegetables, such as a tasty caponata, grilled vegetables and classic baked potatoes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.2 kg  chicken pieces</li>
        <li>1       onion</li>
        <li>1       carrot</li>
        <li>1       stick of celery</li>
        <li>1       clove of garlic</li>
        <li>2       sprigs of rosemary</li>
        <li>100 ml  red wine</li>
        <li>400 g   peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>100 g   black olives</li>
        <li>        extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>        pepper</li>
        <li>        fine salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan, add a drizzle of oil and roughly chop the carrot, onion and celery directly in the pan.</li>
        <li>Light the fire and after a few minutes add the rosemary and the whole garlic clove, and let it brown.</li>
        <li>When the soffritto has wilted, place the chicken pieces in the pan, skin side down, and brown them well.</li>
        <li>Turn it from time to time to brown it on all sides.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper the meat and mix it, then blend with the wine.</li>
        <li>Once the wine has evaporated, add the peeled tomatoes, chopping them, and a little water.</li>
        <li>Let it cook with the lid on, over low heat, for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>When the cooking is almost finished (about 5 minutes) adjust the salt if necessary and then add the black olives and finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Our chicken cacciatore is ready to be served nice and hot and steaming! Enjoy your meal!</li>
