    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta al forno (i.e. 'baked pasta') or timballo di pasta is a typical dish of Italian cuisine, made of (usually short) pasta covered with béchamel sauce, tomato sauce and cheese, and cooked in the oven.</p>
    <p>A quick and easy recipe, which can become an excellent alternative to baked lasagna, perfect for both Sunday lunches and for the lunch break at work.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350 g   mezzi rigatoni (or other type of short pasta)</li>
        <li>200 g   sausages</li>
        <li>500 g   tomato puree</li>
        <li>200 ml  béchamel sauce</li>
        <li>250 g   mozzarella cubed</li>
        <li>40 g    grated cheese</li>
        <li>½       onions</li>
        <li>        extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>        salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pan, fry half a chopped onion in olive oil.</li>
        <li>Break the sausages directly into the pan and brown them.</li>
        <li>Now add the tomato puree, salt to taste and leave to cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, as soon as the water for the pasta starts to boil, add salt and throw in the mezzi rigatoni.</li>
        <li>When the sauce is ready, turn off the heat and add the béchamel, mixing well.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta halfway through cooking and pour it into the pan with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Now also add the diced mozzarella and the grated cheese.

            Keep some cheese and mozzarella aside for the final gratin.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta to a baking dish and spread the remaining mozzarella and grated cheese over the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake and leave to cook in a fan oven at 180°C for approximately 25 minutes or in a static oven at 190°C for the same amount of time.</li>
        <li>Take it out of the oven and wait a few moments for the mozzarella to harden. At that point, distribute it on the plates and serve it hot and steaming, with the mozzarella stringy. You can also make it in advance and heat it in the microwave.</li>
    </ol>
